            <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he inspired me to keep getting the iPhones. I have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and an awesome CEO for Apple. He has inspired me to one day go for and work with Apple when I get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs. He's a great man and I will never forget him.<br>Mushy</p>

            <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every one of my novels and the essays in my two published collections have all been written on Macs. His impact on my life has been profound.<br>Tracy</p>

            <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
            <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.<br>Janna from Seattle, WA</p>

            <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.<br>Anonymous</p>

            <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company, I can't find words to describe my feelings... For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.<br>Eugene</p>

            <p>My thoughts and prayer are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live on in spirit, through the lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my iPhone, iPod, and iPad off for one hour. May Steve rest in peace.<br>Zachary</p>
